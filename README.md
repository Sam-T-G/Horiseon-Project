# Horiseon Project

This Project is an exercise in adhering code to accessibility standards so the site is optimized for search engines.

## Description

This Project explores how elements should be organized to meet accessibility standards. The source code has been modified so that it meets proper HTML semantics, alt-text for placeholders have been added to photo elements, links have been fixed so the navigation properly works and redirects to the correct segment, and both the HTML and CSS files have been reorganized to reduce redundancy and consolidate elements where possible to create a better and more efficient workspace.
